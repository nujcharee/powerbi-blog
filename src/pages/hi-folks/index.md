Hello from the pictureque town called Northallerton, this is where I work in the past 4 years! This is where I started using PowerBI!  I am now a data scientist / data & intelligence specialist

## Sample of PowerBI published work

One of many things I am proud of in life is to be part of OpenNASA's iniative called NASA Datanauts. We are a group of volunteers that do good things with NASA open data. I enjoyed visualising datasets published on ![Open NASA](http://data.nasa.gov).

I am NASA Datanaut from spring 2017 class.

### MeToo hashtag

I use ```r tidytext ``` package to analyse tweets with #metoo hashtag and visualise my analysis with PowerBI.
Apart from trying to tell the story about the movement, I took an opportunity to use Bookmark feature which was just released at the time.
