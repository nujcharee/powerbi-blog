In recent years I have attended many data and technology related meetups. I travelled all around the country to be part of the communities. As an introvert, I dont ususlly successfully network with anyone. In most cases, the majority of the attendees are male, my imposter syndrome introvert self feels intimidated and self-deprecated inner voice continues.

Nevertheless I always continue to be inspired by the topics I learned from the events. 

So if you are an introvert like me, maybe you resonate with my experience above. I am writing this blog in the hope to encourage people, like me, who love to share their learning journey. If self confidence is a barrier that stops, you don't need to struggle anymore.

## You aren't alone
I truly believe that they are communities out there that everyone can feel belong. As for me, Twitter was a good platform for me to learn and engage with online communities, thanks to hashtags #PowerBI and #Rstats.

I started my FIRST EVER powerbi talk a couple of years ago, as a matter of fact it was a virtual session. However that still does count right? :) In reality, my in-real-life data talk was at satRDay in Cardiff - June 2018. I had a good time, I hope my audience did too, I gained confidence and learned from feedback to better myself for my future talks. I have two people to thank - [@janmulkens](https://twitter.com/JanMulkens) Jan Mulkens and Steph Locke [@TheStephLocke](https://twitter.com/TheStephLocke)

#Proving myself wrong
Have you ever thought that you want to prove yourself wrong? This is one of the cases























Have you always aspired to be a phenomenal public speaker? As you know, it takes a lot of preparation and practice to be the presenter you want to be. The ability to speak confidently and deliver a clear, concise, and engaging presentation is what every presenter aims to achieve. 

### Haven't you ever taken a leap of faith? 
Its a Yes from me! Having a career in data profession for the last 20 years, from the outside I look confident and bubbly however speaking in public isn't at all my comfort zone. 


Why do I do it?

Because #SharingIsCaring



In the past couple of years I had attended many data and technology related meetups. These meetups are certainly one of the means to network and keep up-to-date with news and case studies. 

Unfortunately, face to face networking wasnt my thing! 


R and Power BI

Imposter Syndrome Alert!


I started to go outside my comfort zone, bit by bit. I partcipated in data story using PowerBI

Start to gain a bit of confidence here :) little that I know the by product of engaging in online communities could help me battling with my inner self critical voice 

I take a deeper leap this time - 

Thankfully, Jan Mulkens who runs Belgium PowerBI user group had kindly given an opportunity to talk about my data story. I reluctantly accepted the challenge. It was my FIRST EVER talk - and it was a virtual session. 
I didnt know how my audience reacted, after the talk I felt great! I was surprised of myself. 

It wasn't my best but I have learned from feedback from Jan and some who reached out to me for more questions.

One of the difficult things I've found is to find a mentor. It takes commitment for both parties and 








I've learned so much and keep myself up-to-date with news and case studies. 


I have been working as a data professional for the past 20 years, my learning pace has been steadily slow for many reasons.
